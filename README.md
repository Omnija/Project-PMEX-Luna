### Notes
This is a Project PM+EX modpack personal build for educational purposes.

### Compatibility
Wii & Dolphin

We are attempting at making this compatible on both platforms as much as possible.
We also test it on both platform to assure that it does work as intended.

### What We Will be Learning
* Texturing
* Animations
* 3D Modelling
* Sounds & SFX
* File Management

### What's Working
* All modes should be working
* Versus modes work (Disable Items to avoid game crashes)
* L-loading for some characters
* Alt-z loading 
* All alt forms should be working (Metal/invisible etc)
* Extra maps

### What's Not Working
* Voices and wii mote calls disabled
* Netplay untested
* Probably More

### What Needs Fixing
* Victory themes
* Add voices/call and sounds
* Probably more
